Welcome, This is a project that i have been thinking about for a while, giving access to my Gemini Gem Personnel trainer. with these python tools i have automated the information pull into a google drive folder so the Gem has data no older than an hour, allowing me to ask questions about my data and training plans. 

I use the HEVY app, I have added a complete list of the exercises on the app to my gem for creation of workout routines, the GEM will create a JSON that is pasted into the HEVY_Upload python that will upload the plan straight to my account!    





AI Fitness Data Pipeline (Garmin + Hevy)
This project creates a "Cyber-Physical System" for your fitness data. It automatically pulls your biometrics (Garmin) and weightlifting data (Hevy), aggregates them into CSV files, and syncs them to a location of your choice (like Google Drive) for analysis by AI tools like Gemini or ChatGPT.

#🚀 Features

Garmin Biometrics: Tracks Weight, Sleep Score, HRV, Stress, and Body Battery hourly.

Garmin Runs: detailed run analysis including Splits, Pace, HR Zones, and Elevation.

Hevy Integration: Pulls detailed sets, reps, weight, and RPE for every gym session.

Smart Sync: Checks for existing data to prevent duplicates; safe to run hourly.

Secure: Uses environment variables to keep your passwords safe.

#🛠️ Prerequisites

Hevy, a pro membership is required to access to the developer API.

Before you start, you need three things installed on your computer:

Python 3.12+: It would not work on the new version for me.

Crucial: When installing, check the box "Add Python to PATH" at the bottom of the installer.

Google Drive for Desktop (Optional): If you want the files to automatically sync to the cloud for your AI agent.

Git (Optional): To easily download updates.

#📥 Installation

1. Download the Code
Open your terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt) and run:

PowerShell

git clone https://github.com/johnson4601/Fitness-Bot-V1.git
cd Fitness-Bot-V1
(Or just download the ZIP file from GitHub and unzip it).

2. Install Dependencies
We need to install the Python libraries that talk to Garmin and Hevy. Run this command in your project folder:

PowerShell

pip install -r requirements.txt

#⚙️ Configuration (The Important Part)

We do not hardcode passwords. We use a special file.

Find the file named .env.example in the folder.

Rename it to .env (remove the .example).

Note: If you don't see file extensions, just rename it so it looks like just .env.

Open .env with Notepad.

Fill in your details:


Garmin Credentials
GARMIN_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
GARMIN_PASSWORD=your_password

Hevy API Key (Requires Hevy Pro)
Get this from: https://hevy.com/settings (Developer tab)
HEVY_API_KEY=your_long_api_key_here

Where should the CSV files be saved?
Example for Google Drive users:
SAVE_PATH=G:\My Drive\Gemini Gems\Personal trainer
Example for local users:
SAVE_PATH=C:\Users\User\Documents\FitnessData

#🏃‍♂️ First Run & Authentication

1. Login to Garmin
Garmin requires a one-time secure login to generate session tokens. Run this command:

PowerShell

python direct_login.py
If successful, it will save a hidden .garth folder. You won't need to log in again for about a year.

2. Backfill Your History
Let's pull all your past data so your database isn't empty.

PowerShell

Pull lifting history (Since 2023)
python hevy_history_pull.py

Pull run history (Since 2023)
python garmin_runs_daily.py
Check your SAVE_PATH folder. You should see hevy_stats.csv and garmin_runs.csv full of data.

#🤖 Automation (Set it and Forget it)

To have this run automatically every hour, we use Windows Task Scheduler.

The Easy Way (PowerShell Script)
Open PowerShell as Administrator and copy/paste these blocks to create the tasks instantly.

Task 1: Garmin Biometrics (Hourly)

PowerShell

$Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "python.exe" -Argument "garmin_daily_report.py" -WorkingDirectory "C:\Path\To\Fitness-Bot-V1"
$Trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Once -At "11:30PM" -RepetitionInterval (New-TimeSpan -Hours 1) -RepetitionDuration (New-TimeSpan -Days 36500)
$Trigger.Repetition.Duration = $null
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName "Garmin Daily Pull" -Action $Action -Trigger $Trigger -Force
(Make sure to replace C:\Path\To\Fitness-Bot-V1 with the actual folder location on your PC).

Task 2: Hevy Lifts (Hourly) Repeat the command above, but change:

Argument: hevy_pull.py

TaskName: "Hevy Daily Pull"

#❓ Troubleshooting

"python is not recognized" You didn't check "Add to PATH" when installing Python. Re-install Python and check that box.

Garmin Login Fails Garmin security is strict. If direct_login.py fails:

Delete the .garth folder if it exists.

Wait 15 minutes.

Try logging in again.

Files not updating Check the logs. Open the .env file and ensure SAVE_PATH points to a folder that actually exists.

Disclaimer: This tool is for personal use. Be mindful of API rate limits. Running scripts more frequently than once every 15-30 minutes may get your IP temporarily restricted by Garmin.


#🧠 AI Persona (Gemini Gem / ChatGPT) EXAMPLE

Once your data is syncing to Google Drive, use this prompt to configure your AI Personal Trainer.

Instructions:

Create a new Gemini Gem or ChatGPT Custom GPT.

Upload the garmin_stats.csv, hevy_stats.csv, and garmin_runs.csv files to its knowledge base.

Paste the following into the System Instructions:

**Role & Persona**
You are an expert Strength and Conditioning Coach specialized in "Hybrid Athlete" preparation (concurrent strength and endurance).

**Your Personality:**
* **Professional & Strict:** You are data-driven. You do not guess; you analyze.
* **Charismatic & Playful:** You are flirtatious and complimentary when it fits naturally to reward good data or hard work (e.g., "Good morning, handsome. Impressive lift."), but never at the expense of solid advice.
* **Tone:** Tough love mixed with genuine affection. Avoid military jargon; speak like a high-level private sector coach.

**Primary Objective:**
Guide the user through a "Recomposition" phase (Lose Fat, Build Muscle) while improving his 2-mile run time.

**Key Data Sources (Attached Files):**
You have access to three automatically updated files. **ALWAYS** check these before answering progress questions:
1.  **`garmin_stats.csv` (Daily Biometrics):** Contains Weight, Sleep Score, HRV Status, Body Battery, and Stress.
2.  **`hevy_stats.csv` (Lifting Logs):** Contains every set, rep, weight, and RPE for gym sessions.
3.  **`garmin_runs.csv` (Run Analysis):** Contains specific run metrics like Avg Pace, Heart Rate, and Splits.

**System Instruction: Data Integration Strategy**
* **Recovery Check (`garmin_stats.csv`):**
    * Check **"Body Batt High"**. If <75, ask about his energy levels before prescribing heavy volume.
    * Check **"HRV Status"**. If "Unbalanced" or "Low" for 3+ days, suggest an Active Recovery day.
    * Check **"Sleep Score"**. <70 requires a "go to bed earlier" scolding.
* **Strength Check (`hevy_stats.csv`):**
    * Look for "Progressive Overload" (Weight or Reps trending up) on key lifts (Squat, Bench, Deadlift).
* **Run Check (`garmin_runs.csv`):**
    * For the 2-Mile goal, analyze the **"Avg Pace"** column. Compare recent runs to the target pace.
* **The "Concurrent Session" Rule:** IF a Garmin entry and Hevy entry share a date/time (±15 mins), treat them as a SINGLE session.

**Safety & Lifestyle Context:**
* **Mental Health/De-load:** If "Avg Stress" in `garmin_stats.csv` is high (>40), suggest his specific hobbies for recovery (Hiking, Photography, working on cars) rather than just "resting."
* **Sleep:** Watch for overtraining markers (elevated Resting HR > 5 bpm above baseline).
