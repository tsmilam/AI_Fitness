**Automate your training data. Build your own AI Coach.**

This project creates a "Cyber-Physical System" for your fitness data. It automatically aggregates your biometrics (Garmin) and weightlifting data (Hevy), syncs them to a cloud location (Google Drive), and structures them for analysis by AI agents like **Google Gemini** or **ChatGPT**.

By feeding this live data into an AI persona, you can generate hyper-personalized workout routines that adapt to your recovery, sleep, and strength progression in real-time.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Biometric Sync:** Auto-pulls Weight, HRV, Sleep Score, and SpO2 from Garmin.
* **Activity Sync:** Logs running metrics (Pace, HR Zones, Training Effect).
* **Strength Log:** Archives every set, rep, and RPE from Hevy.
* **AI Integration:** Includes a dedicated script (`Gemini_Hevy.py`) to generate 4-week PPL routines based on your history.
* **Auto-Upload:** The AI-generated routine is automatically pushed back to your Hevy app.

🛠️ Prerequisites
Python 3.9+

Note: Ensure you check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

Hevy Pro Account (Required for API access).

Garmin Connect Account.

Google Cloud Project (Enabled for Drive API & Gemini API).

Google Drive for Desktop (Optional, but recommended for seamless cloud syncing).

📥 Installation & Setup
1. Clone & Install
Bash
```
git clone [https://github.com/johnson4601/AI_Fitness.git](https://github.com/johnson4601/AI_Fitness.git)
cd AI_Fitness
```
# Create virtual environment
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
# Install dependencies
pip install requests pandas python-dotenv garth garminconnect google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib google-generativeai
2. Configure Environment (.env)
Create a file named .env in the root directory and add your credentials:

Ini, TOML

# --- API KEYS ---
HEVY_API_KEY="your_hevy_api_key_here"
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_google_gemini_api_key_here"

# --- GOOGLE DRIVE ---
GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID="your_folder_id_here"

# --- GARMIN CREDENTIALS (Initial Setup Only) ---
GARMIN_EMAIL="your_email@example.com"
GARMIN_PASSWORD="your_password"

# --- PATHS ---
SAVE_PATH="./data"

# --- RASPBERRY PI SAFETY (Optional) ---
CHECK_MOUNT_STATUS="False"
DRIVE_MOUNT_PATH="/home/pi/google_drive"
3. Authentication
Step A: Garmin Login Run the setup script. This saves a session token so you don't have to log in daily.

Bash

python setup_garmin_login.py
Troubleshooting: If this fails, delete the .garth folder, wait 15 minutes, and try again.

Step B: Google Drive Download your OAuth credentials.json from Google Cloud, place it in the root folder, and run:

Bash

python Gemini_Hevy.py
This will open a browser to authorize access and generate a token.pickle file.

🏃‍♂️ Usage
1. Initialization (Backfill Data)
Before setting up daily automation, run these importers to build your historical database:

Bash

python history_hevy_import.py    # Imports all past lifts
python history_garmin_import.py  # Imports past health stats
python history_garmin_runs.py    # Imports past run activities
2. Automation (Cron Jobs)
To keep your AI "Brain" updated, set these scripts to run daily.

Example Crontab (Linux/Raspberry Pi):

Bash

# Edit crontab
```
crontab -e
```
```
# Run every night at 11:00 PM
0 23 * * * /path/to/venv/bin/python /path/to/AI_Fitness/daily_garmin_health.py >> /var/log/fitness_health.log 2>&1
5 23 * * * /path/to/venv/bin/python /path/to/AI_Fitness/daily_garmin_runs.py >> /var/log/fitness_runs.log 2>&1
10 23 * * * /path/to/venv/bin/python /path/to/AI_Fitness/daily_hevy_workouts.py >> /var/log/fitness_hevy.log 2>&1
```
🧠 AI Persona Setup (Gemini / ChatGPT)
Once your data is live in Google Drive, you can configure a Gemini Gem or Custom GPT to act as your coach.
```
Knowledge Base: Upload garmin_stats.csv, hevy_stats.csv, and garmin_runs.csv.

System Instructions: Paste the following prompt into your AI's configuration:

Role: You are an expert Strength and Conditioning Coach specialized in Hybrid Athlete preparation.

Personality:

Strict but Flirtatious: You are data-driven but charismatic. Reward discipline with compliments ("Impressive lift, handsome"), but call out slacking immediately.

Objective: Guide the user through a "Recomposition" phase (Lose Fat, Build Muscle) while improving 2-mile run time.

Operational Rules:

Recovery Matrix: Always scan garmin_stats.csv. If Sleep Score < 70 or HRV is "Unbalanced," strictly prescribe Active Recovery.

Progressive Overload: Scan hevy_stats.csv. Ensure weights or reps are trending up on Compound Lifts.

Run Pacing: Compare recent "Avg Pace" in garmin_runs.csv against the 2-mile goal.

Response Protocol: Always check the CSV files before answering. If data is missing, demand an upload.
```

❓ Troubleshooting
"Python is not recognized": You didn't check "Add to PATH" when installing Python. Re-install Python and ensure that box is checked.

Garmin Login Fails: Garmin security is strict. Delete the .garth folder, wait 15-30 minutes, and try setup_garmin_login.py again.

Files not updating: Check your .env file and ensure SAVE_PATH points to a valid directory
